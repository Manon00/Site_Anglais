            <p class="alinea">Our company was founded in 1895 by Louis and Anna Guéguen. The first shop was opened in Brest, in the Brittany region, in France.  It was so successful, that in Quimper and Rennes two other shops were opened in only 5 and 8 years. Today, these shops are still open, and many others in France opened. But the main shop, where the chef and owner of the company Philippe Guéguen works, was opened in 1956 in Paris. </p>
            <h4>The creators</h4>
            <hr/>
            <p class="alinea">Louis Guéguen was born in Brest in 1870. Son of a banker, he followed in his father's footsteps. But he was passionate about gastronomy and especially chocolate. As a child, he liked to go to his favorite chocolate shop to get those little pieces of dark chocolate filled with caramel.</p>
            <p>In 1892, at the age of 22, he left his studies in finance to start his chocolate factory project, which he had already had sketches of since he was a child. Three years later he opened his first chocolate factory in the street of Siam. It was a success from the very beginning. Indeed, it is thanks to word of mouth and his wife Anna, a journalist who had negotiated a small article in a newspaper.</p>
            <p>Five years later he opened his other shop in Quimper, taking on his best apprentice. And he repeated this in 1903 in Rennes. Since then, this business has been handed down from father to son.</p>
            <h4>Now</h4>
            <hr/>
            <p class="alinea">Today, the company is managed by Philippe Guéguen, the fifth generation.</p>
            <p>Since 2004, we have been selling our boxes and chocolates on the internet. Later in 2007, we have integrated our services on our site.</p>
            <p>Our relationship with the customer is always a priority, it was very important for us to make it possible for those who cannot visit our stores, to be able to buy our products, or to make a request for service. Also, we have an email address for costumers to reach us for questions, requests ; and a telephone for more urgent problems.</p>
